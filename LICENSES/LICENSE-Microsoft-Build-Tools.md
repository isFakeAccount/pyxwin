# Microsoft Software License Terms

## Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Remote Debugger, IntelliTrace Collector, other debuggers, agents, and build tools

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or, based on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and to any Microsoft services or updates for the software unless those have different terms.

**If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights described below.**

## Installation and use rights

- **Supplement to Visual Studio Products.** This software is licensed as a supplement to Visual Studio Community, Visual Studio Professional, and Visual Studio Enterprise (collectively, “Visual Studio Products”). Use of the software requires a valid license to one of the Visual Studio Products.

- **Copies for development.** You may install and use any number of copies of the software to develop, build, and test applications created with Visual Studio Products.

- **Visual Studio Code.** With a valid Visual Studio Products license you may also use the software with Visual Studio Code.

- **Open Source Dependencies.** If you do not have a valid Visual Studio Products license, you may still install and use the software to compile and build C++ components that:

  - have been released under an OSI-approved open-source license, and
  - are reasonably required to build your applications.

  These are referred to as “Open Source Dependencies.”

- **Restrictions for Open Source Dependencies.** You may not use the software under the Open Source Dependencies exception to develop and test those dependencies, except for minor modifications necessary to compile and build them. "Minor modifications" are changes that do not significantly change functionality or structure (for example, fixing typos or adjusting build script options).

## Terms for specific components

- **Utilities.** The software includes items on the Utilities List: [https://aka.ms/vs/17/utilities](https://aka.ms/vs/17/utilities). You may copy and install those items to debug and deploy applications and databases developed with Visual Studio Products. Utilities are intended for temporary use and may not receive separate patches. Delete Utilities after debugging or deployment to avoid unintended access. Microsoft is not responsible for third-party access to devices where Utilities are installed.

- **Build Devices and Build Tools.** You may copy and install files from the software onto your build devices (physical, virtual, or containers, on-premises or hosted) and use them to:

  - compile, build, and verify applications developed with Visual Studio Products;
  - compile, build, and verify applications developed with Visual Studio Code if you also have a valid Visual Studio Products license; and
  - compile, build, and verify Open Source Dependencies;

  and to run quality or performance tests as part of the build process.

- **Microsoft Platforms.** The software may include components governed by separate license terms (Windows, SQL Server, Exchange, Office, SharePoint, etc.). Those components are governed by their own license terms as described in the accompanying "Licenses" folder or installation directory.

- **Third-party components.** The software may include third-party components with separate legal notices or agreements listed in the accompanying notices file(s).

## Data

- **Data collection.** The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send it to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve products. You may be able to opt out of some data collection scenarios as described in the documentation. Some features may enable collection of data from users of your applications; if you use those features you must comply with applicable law and provide appropriate notices, including Microsoft’s privacy statement: [https://aka.ms/privacy](https://aka.ms/privacy).

- **Processing of personal data.** To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor for personal data, Microsoft makes commitments in the EU GDPR Terms of the Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum (effective May 25, 2018): [https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/gdpr](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/gdpr).

## Scope of license

The software is licensed, not sold. These license terms give you specific rights to use the software; Microsoft reserves all other rights. You must comply with technical limitations in the software and you may not:

- work around technical limitations;
- reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software except as required by applicable third-party open-source licensing;
- remove or modify Microsoft or supplier notices in the software;
- use the software unlawfully;
- share, publish, rent, or lease the software; or
- provide the software as a stand-alone offering or transfer the software or this agreement to a third party.

## Feedback

If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you grant Microsoft a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable right to use, share, and commercialize that feedback. Do not submit feedback that is under a license that would require Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties.

## Support services

This software is provided "as-is" and Microsoft may not provide support services for it.

## Entire agreement

These license terms, together with terms for supplements, updates, and Internet-based services, are the entire agreement for the software and any support services.

## Export restrictions

You must comply with applicable export laws and regulations. For more information see: [https://www.microsoft.com/exporting](https://www.microsoft.com/exporting).

## Applicable law

If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs interpretation and claims for breach of this agreement; the laws of your home state apply to other claims. If you acquired the software elsewhere, local law applies.

## Consumer rights; regional variations

These terms describe certain legal rights and do not affect statutory consumer rights in your country or state where those rights cannot be waived. Examples:

- **Australia.** You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law.
- **Canada.** You can stop receiving updates by turning off Internet access; updates resume when you reconnect.
- **Germany and Austria.**

  - **(i) Warranty.** Properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in accompanying Microsoft materials, but Microsoft provides no contractual guarantee.

  - **(ii) Limitation of Liability.** Microsoft is liable under applicable statutory law for intentional conduct, gross negligence, death, or personal injury. For slight negligence, liability is limited to breaches of cardinal obligations.

## Disclaimer of warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS". YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT PROVIDES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXCLUDED.

## Limitation on and exclusion of damages

YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to claims related to the software, services, third-party content or applications, and covers contract, warranty, tort, and other claims to the extent permitted by law. It may not apply in all jurisdictions where exclusions or limitations of certain damages are prohibited.
