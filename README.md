# pyxwin

A utility for downloading and packaging the Python, Microsoft CRT, Windows SDK headers and libraries needed for compiling and linking python extension modules targeting Windows.

The project is inspired by the rust based [xwin](https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin) cargo package in python.

The goal is to let Python users download Python, Microsoft CRT and Windows SDK that each contain all of the necessary includes and libraries needed for an application to compile and link Python extension modules from a non-Windows platform, using a native cross compiling toolchain like clang/LLVM. This includes adding symlinks to correct numerous casing issues in the Windows SDK so that the files generated by this program can function on a case-sensitive file system.
